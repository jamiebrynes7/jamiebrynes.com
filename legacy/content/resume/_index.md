## Work History

### Improbable

_Software Engineer · September 2017 to present_

Responsible for designing and building the [GDK for Unity](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity), an integration between SpatialOS and the Unity game engine. Co-authored major components of the product including: the code generation framework, CI infrastructure, and API docs generation pipeline. 

The GDK focuses on providing Unity game developers with a powerful networking synchronization framework that supports both GameObject and the new ECS workflows.

**Technologies**

### Hewlett Packard Enterprise

_ASIC R&D Intern · Summer 2016_

Designed and developed an assembly simulator for a parallel computational slice containing two ALU units and a single memory manipulation unit. Implemented a CLI for access to the simulator and memory dumps.

Designed and developed a flexible and permutable code generator for microcode programs.

**Technologies**

Python, C++

## Education

### University of Oxford

_MEng in Engineering Science · October 2013 - June 2017_

Graduated with first class honors. My first two years provided me with strong and broad engineering foundations, while my latter two years I delved into electronic & information engineering.

My third year, I took part in a year long group project to design a commercially viable optical fabrication facility capable of submicron resolutions. I designed software to take an input of a 3D model file and generate a series of actions for an optical fabrication system.

My final year, I undertook research into harnessing signals from modern smartphones to provide high-accuracy physical activity markers. The result of this research was published at the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.
