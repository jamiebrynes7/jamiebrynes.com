Another year, another rewrite of my personal website...

<!--more-->

I had been using [NextJS](http://nextjs.org/) as the framework for this website, but really became frustrated with the fragility of the web ecosystem. When coming back to the project after a year or so, I just ended up fighting package updates. Things that I'd really rather _not_ be doing.

Instead, I've changed back to a more straightforward static site generator: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This ends up simplifying the entire process and generates small websites to boot!
