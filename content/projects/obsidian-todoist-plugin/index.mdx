This project is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin which allows you to materialize Todoist task queries into your notes.

<!-- more -->

It makes use of the [Todoist REST API](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v1/) to fetch the underlying task data and the [Obsidian plugin API](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api) along with Svelte to render the tasks.
