The website you are looking at is open source and handcrafted using [Zola](http://getzola.org/) and the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework. It is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and uses [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for some [additional interactive features](/blog/kudos-please/).
