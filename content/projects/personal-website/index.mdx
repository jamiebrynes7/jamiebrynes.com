The website you're looking at is open source and handcrafted by me!

<!--/excerpt-->

This website is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I had a few requirements for my personal website:

- it had to allow for my writing (when I get around to it)
- it had to showcase any projects that I've been working on
- it should be well optimized and bloat free

This set of requirments lends itself well to static site generators, like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), and I did have an iteration of this website that was built with one of these tools. However, I had an itch to scratch and shiny new tech to try out, so I [rewrote it](/posts/website-rewrite/).

Over time, I'd like to expand this website and share more with the world. But, for now, I'm happy with it!
