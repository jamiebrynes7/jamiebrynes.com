The website you're looking at is open source and handcrafted by me!

<!--more-->

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I had a few requirements for my personal website:

- it had to allow for my writing (when I get around to it)
- it had to showcase any projects that I've been working on
- it should be well optimized and bloat free

TODO: Write remainder.
