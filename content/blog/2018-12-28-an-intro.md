My name is Jamie Brynes, I'm a 23 year old software engineer working at Improbable. This blog is a place for me to write on topics and jot down thoughts that I find interesting or useful, focusing on technical subject material, but not limited to it. 

I hope that you will find something worth reading here. Be on the lookout for future content!
