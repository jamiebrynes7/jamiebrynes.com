My name is Jamie Brynes, I'm a 23 year old software engineer currently working at Improbable. This blog is a place for me to write down thoughts and things that I find interesting or useful, mostly focusing on technical subject material but not exclusively limited to it. 

I hope that you will find something worth reading here. Be on the lookout for future content!
