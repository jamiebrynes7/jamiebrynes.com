    "Graduated with first class honors. My first two years provided me with strong engineering foundations, while my latter two years I delved into electronic & information engineering.", 
    "My third year, I took part in a year long group project to design a commercially viable optical fabrication facility capable of submicron resolutions. I designed software to take an input of a 3D model file and generate a series of actions for an optical fabrication system.",
    "My final year, I undertook research into harnessing signals from modern smartphones and to provide high-accuracy physical activity markers. The result of this resaerch was published at the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society."
